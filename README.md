# üì° Mahalanobis-Distance-Based-Open-Set-Recognition-in-RFFI-Settings-using-Learnable-Vector-Quantization
This repository presents a **Mahalanobis distance-based open set recognition framework** for radio frequency fingerprinting identification (**RFFI**). Leveraging **learnable vector quantization**, the model provides robust device classification and reliably detects unknown devices in real-world wireless environments.

## üìñ Overview

### üîç Motivation
Traditional RFFI approaches often assume a **closed-set** scenario, where all test devices are seen during training. However, in real-world settings, new, previously unseen devices may appear‚Äîa challenge known as **open set recognition (OSR)**.  
This work tackles open set recognition for RFFI, proposing a solution based on learnable vector quantization and Mahalanobis distance for improved generalization and unknown detection.

### üí° Our Contribution
We propose the following innovations:
1. **Learnable Vector Quantization**:  
   Incorporates a vector quantization layer whose codebook is learned jointly with the encoder, allowing for flexible representation of device fingerprints.
2. **Mahalanobis Distance-based Classification**:  
   Utilizes Mahalanobis distance in latent space, leveraging the full covariance structure for robust device classification and outlier detection.
3. **Open Set Evaluation**:  
   Provides comprehensive benchmarks for both seen (closed set) and unseen (open set) devices, highlighting the advantages of our approach.

**Pipeline Steps:**
1. **Signal Acquisition**  
   - Raw RF signals are captured from wireless devices.
2. **Feature Extraction (Encoder)**  
   - A neural network encoder maps the signal to a compact latent representation.
3. **Learnable Vector Quantization**  
   - The latent features are quantized using a learnable codebook.
4. **Mahalanobis Distance-Based Classification**  
   - Device identity is inferred by measuring Mahalanobis distances in the codebook space. Unknown (open set) devices are detected as outliers.
5. **Open Set Detection**  
   - Thresholding the Mahalanobis score enables distinguishing between known and unknown devices.
