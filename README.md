# Mahalanobis-Distance-Based-Open-Set-Recognition-in-RFFI-Settings-using-Learnable-Vector-Quantization
This repository presents a Mahalanobis distance-based open set recognition framework for radio frequency fingerprinting identification (RFFI). Leveraging learnable vector quantization, the model provides robust device classification and reliably detects unknown devices in real-world wireless environments.
